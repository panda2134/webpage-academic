I'm a PhD student at University of Wisconsin - Madison, mainly studying programming languages, including formal verification and program synthesis.

In the past, I had the opportunity to be advised by [Prof. Loris D'Antoni](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ldantoni/) who is very energetic at doing research.
I'm currently working with [Prof. Tej Chajed](https://www.chajed.io) on file system verification.

When I don't do research, I mess up with [amateur radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio), play video games (while also [*modding*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding) them), and watch animes.
